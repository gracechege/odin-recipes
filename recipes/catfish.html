<p>This fried catfish recipe is a classic Southern dish traditionally served with buttermilk hush puppies and <br/>buttermilk coleslaw.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 pound catfish fillets, cut in stripes</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups fine cornmeal</li>
    <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old <br/>Bay™</li>
    <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour mixture into a flat <br/>pan large enough to hold fillets. Arrange fillets in a single layer in the pan, <br/>turning to coat each side. Set aside to marinate.</li>
    <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, and seafood seasoning in a 2-gallon resealable plastic <br/>bag. Add fillets to the bag, a few at a time, and tumble gently until evenly <br/>coated.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Fry fillets in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Work in <br/>batches to avoid overcrowding, so fillets have room to brown properly. Drain on <br/>paper towels.</li>
</ol>
